<font color="red">Note: the GOSEEK Reinforcement Learning (virtual) challenge will take place irrespective of ICRA. </font> 

We are organizing the GOSEEK challenge, where participants create an RL agent that combines perception and high-level decision-making to search for objects placed within complex indoor environments from a Unity-based simulator. Simply put: like PACMAN, but in a realistic scene and with realistic perception capabilities. Several data modalities will be provided from both the simulator ground truth and a perception pipeline (e.g., images, depth, agent location) to enable the participants to focus on the RL/search aspects. The contest will be hosted on the EvalAI platform, where participants will submit solutions, via docker containers run on AWS instances, for scoring. The winner of the competition will receive a monetary prize and will give a keynote presentation at the workshop.
